##################################################
1.  Download Raspbian Jessie lite: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
    Download Etcher: https://etcher.io/
    Using Etcher, burn image of Raspbian to a microSD card (noted sd0). 
    Unmount sd0, put it into a Raspberry Pi. 

2.  Connect the Raspberry Pi  to a monitor and a keyboard (before plug in the charger)
    From Nov 2016, the ssh option of Raspbian is turned off by default (so stupid!!!) so we have to turn it on. 
    After plugging in the charger, we can see the terminal of Raspbian on the monitor. 
        username: pi
        password: raspberry
	
3.  Configure the Raspberry Pi:
    sudo raspi-config
        - Expand Filesystem
        - Change Timezone, Keyboard Layout, Location
        - Change password to thumargot
        - Advanced Options: Turn on SSH, Change Hostname to rpi0
    Disconnect the RaspberryPi from the monitor and the keyboard
    
4.  Connect the Raspberry to the same network as your computer then
        sudo apt install nmap
        nmap -p22 192.168.1.0/24
    to get the IP adresse of the RaspberryPi
    
5.  Connect to the Raspberry through ssh
        ssh pi@IPadress
    Now we will work on the Raspberry
    
6.  Update and upgrade
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt spgrade
    
7.  Install newest version of R
        sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
            deb http://mirrordirector.raspbian.org/raspbian/ jessie main contrib non-free rpi
            # Uncomment line below then 'apt-get update' to enable 'apt-get source'
            deb-src http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian/ jessie main contrib non-free rpi
            deb http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian/ stretch main
            
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt upgrade (really long)
        sudo apt autoremove
        sudo apt install r-base r-base-core r-base-dev
        
8.  Install MPICH
        sudo apt install mpich
    test
        mpiexec -n 1 hostname
        
9.  Install NFS
        sudo apt install nfs-common
        
10. Turn off the Raspberry, put sd0 to the card reader.
    Create an image of Raspbian
        sudo dd bs=4M if=/dev/sdd of=raspbian-cluster.img 
        # replace sdd by the correct location of the SD card
    Burn the created image to the other 5 microSD cards
    
11. On each RaspberryPi:
        sudo raspi-config 
            -> Change hostname to rpi1, rpi2, rpi3, rpi4, rpi5
